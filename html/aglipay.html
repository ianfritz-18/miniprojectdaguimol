                <td>The Aglipay Shrine at Pinili, Ilocos Norte, is a historical place related to the guerilla activities of OM Aglipay in that Filipino-American War from 1899 to 1901. The shrine is located at formerly Brgy. Kullabeng, now Brgy. Aglipay. The place is the home of a wartime comrade of OM Aglipay, Captain Ignacio Lafradez, who hosted the birthday celebration of OM Aglipay on May 8, 1902.

                    In that meeting, which some of IFI members called the Kullabeng Assembly, many of the participants were the wartime comrades of OM Aglipay. They, together with the Aglipay and the Ilocano clergy, declared to establish a new Church, separate from Rome with the slogan, “An independent church in an independent Philippines.” (Willian Henry Scott, 1960).
                    
                    The Kullabeng Shrine of OM Aglipay was established to commemorate the founding of the town Pinili which OM Aglipay gave its name, which means “chosen.” On January 1, 2020, the Municipality of Pinili had celebrated its centenary.
                    
                    Pinili is located in the mountainous areas of Ilocos Norte along with Badoc, Nueva Era, Marcos, Vintar, and La Paz, Abra. This was the headquarters of the guerilla forces led by a guerilla padre, General Gregorio Aglipay, against the Americans.
                    
                    Dr. Troy Alexander G. Miano, in “Aglipay Markers” (October 3, 2019), talked about the markers of Aglipay Shrine at Pinlii. He is from Cabatuan, Isabela, who narrated that as “Part of the immersion tour package of the Association of Tourism Officers of the Philippines (ATOP) 20th National Convention is Batac City,” he visited the Aglipay Shrine at Pinili. Here is the excerpt:
                    
                    “There are three official markers in the Aglipay Shrine. The first was issued by the Local Government of Pinili, Ilocos Norte, upon the inauguration of the shrine on November 29, 1997. The stainless marker situated at the left side of the entrance to the monument enumerates the municipal officials headed by Mayor Samuel S. Pagdilao and national and provincial officials, namely: President Fidel V. Ramos, Senator Heherson T. Alvarez, Congressman Simeon M. Valdez, and Governor Rodolfo C. Fariñas. The shrine lot was donated by the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Rev. Fr. Leonardo Cuaresma & Rev. Fr. Felino Raña, Jr.), Independent Church of Filipino Christians (Rev. Fr. Erwin Abella), Mrs. Elizabeth M. Peralta, Mr. & Mrs. Jesus C. Blanco, Miss Jesusa P. Cabie, Mrs. Trifina P. Peralta and Mr. & Mrs. Buenaventura L. Raña. The shrine was a collaborated project led by Senator Heherson T. Alvarez and the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA) headed by General Manager Eduardo T. Joaquin.
