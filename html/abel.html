                <td>The provincial government of Ilocos Norte inaugurated on Sunday a new weaving center in Barangay Lumbaan-Bicbica of Pinili, the cotton capital of Ilocos Norte. This was made as a tribute to the National Living Treasure recipient Magdalena Gamayo, a Filipino weaver who turned 99 years old on the same day.

                    The Pinili Inabel Center is situated on a 290-square-meter plot next to Gamayo's previous residence. She donated this land to the government to preserve their heritage of weaving cotton, which they call in Ilocano "inabel." 
                    
                    Now serving as a public space for local weavers in Ilocos Norte to improve their skills, Gamayo hopes that younger generations will learn to appreciate inabel weaving through this center.
